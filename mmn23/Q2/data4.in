Once upon a time, there was a small village in the @b* mountains where a kind-hearted farmer named Jack lived. Jack had a magical beanstalk that reached the clouds, and one @*b day he climbed it to discover a giant's castle. The giant caught Jack and kept him as a prisoner, but Jack managed to steal a hen that laid golden eggs and escaped back down the beanstalk. When he arrived back in the village, he sold the eggs and became very wealthy, but the giant came to retrieve what was his and a great battle took place. In the end, Jack managed to chop down the beanstalk and the giant fell to his death. From that day on, Jack lived a happy life with his wealth and was loved by all in the village. The end.@*b
