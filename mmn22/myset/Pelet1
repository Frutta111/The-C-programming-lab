Hi! I'm going to introduce to you our new interactice caculator. 
This caculator will do some operations on set numbers. 
We are going to learn step by step how to use it well.
The command line use to include the relevant name of sets, potentially command in the right struct of line.
The potentially commands on the numbers are : read_set, print_set, union_set, intersect_set, sub_set and symdiff_set 
The potentially names of sets are : SETA, SETB, SETC, SETD, SETE and SETF (with capital letters). 
The numbers we will enter to each set sould be between 0 - 127. 
The struct of the line is different if we use different commands : 
if we use read_set, the line should be : |read_set| |name of set|, |number|, |number|,... to end it enter -1 and then |enter| 
For example : read_set SETB, 5,67,89,-1 and |enter| 
Note: there is no output aftar read_set operation. 
if we use print_set, the line should be : |print_set| |name of set| and then |enter| , for example: 
print_set SETC and |enter| 
if we use union_set, intersect_set, sub_set and symdiff_set, the line should be : |command| |name of first set|, |name of second set|, |name of thirs set| and then |enter| .
The result of the operetion on the two first sets, enters to the third set. 
For example: sub_set SETC, SETD, SETB and |enter| 
If there is a problem, it will print you message 
To end the program write : |stop| and then |enter| and |enter| 
For example : stop 
Enjoy!
